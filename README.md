# ðŸš€ Node.js Backend Projects

This repository is a collection of **backend projects** built with:

- **Node.js** (runtime)
- **Express.js** (web framework)
- **MySQL** (database)
- **REST API** principles

The goal of this repo is to practice and demonstrate how to build real-world backend applications with clean structure and reusable patterns.
